# Figure 1

Figure 1 contains the following panels.

Panel (a): Mr. Pokey, description of experiment P1902 (not found here on GitHub)
Panel (b): Comparison of Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA F p-values for measuring clonality.
Panel (c): UMAP clustering based on all genes, clonal genes, and highly variable genes.
Panel (d): Heatmap based on clonal genes.
Panel (e): The SVM clonal prediction
Panel (f): Accuracy of clonal prediction by linear SVM.
Panel (g): Violin plots of genes, by cells within 9 clones and population-wide.

The notebook creating most of these panels is contained in this directory.  The panels are available, mostly as PDFs, in the Panels subdirectory.  The heatmap has been converted to a PNG graphic, to make it easier to import without overloading Adobe Illustrator.  The SVM schematic is included as an Adobe Illustrator file and PNG export.  THe individual violin plots are contained in the ClonalGenes subdirectory of the Panels directory.
