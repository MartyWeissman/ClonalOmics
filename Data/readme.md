# Data

The raw data is not included for now.  Instead, the preprocessing notebooks are contained here, along with their outputs (in the Processed folder).  Most processed data is in loom format, containing AnnData objects for use with ScanPy.  Occasionally pickles (.pkl) are used, for storing Pandas dataframes.

Some very large loom files are not included here on GitHub.  Please email Marty Weissman at weissman DOT marty AT gmail DOT com, if you would like those loom files or others not found here.
