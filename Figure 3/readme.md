Here we study the chromatin accessibility (ATAC peak heights), gene expression (mRNA counts), and a bit of protein abundance for experiment P9855.

* Panel (a):  Heatmap of clonal peaks
* Panel (b):  Unsupervised UMAP clustering based on 80000+ peaks.
* Panel (c):  Peak variability.
* Panel (d):  Peaks within a window around genes, correlations, and eigenpeaks.
* Panel (e):  Peak~gene correlations near all TSS.
* Panel (f):  Summary of all genes, from principal component regression.
* Panel (g):  Multiomics plots:  gene expression, nearby peaks, and sometimes protein abundance, for a few select genes.
