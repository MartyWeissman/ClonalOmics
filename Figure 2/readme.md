# Figure 2:  Stable clonal behaviors

Main questions: are the stable behaviors identified in the previous dataset (P1902) short-term or long-term.  Are they stable across different activation events which trigger massive changes in cell state -- activation of a resting memory T cell to become effectors?

* Panel (a):  Mr. Pokey
* Panel (b):  Confusion matrix, all clones.
* Panel (c):  Confusion matrix, sister clones.
* Panel (d):  Heatmap, sister clones.
* Panel (e):  Clone and well significance.
* Panel (f):  Violins.
